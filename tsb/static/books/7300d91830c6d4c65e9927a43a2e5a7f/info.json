    "Description": "Here is a summary of the text:\n\nThe story begins with Abraham and Lot living together. However, God sends them separate messages: one good for Abraham and one bad for Lot. The angel appears to Abraham in the form of three men, and Abraham treats them kindly and invites them into his home. One of the angels tells Abraham that his wife Sarah will have a son.\n\nAbraham's wife Sarah is afraid when she hears this news, but the angel reassures her that it will happen. Meanwhile, Lot lives in the city of Sodom with his family.\n\nGod informs Abraham that He plans to destroy Sodom because of its wickedness and tells Abraham to speak on behalf of the people there. Abraham argues with God, suggesting that perhaps there are only 50 righteous people in Sodom, then 45, then 40, then 30, then 20, and finally asks if even 10 good people would be enough to save the city.\n\nGod agrees that even 10 good people would be enough, and Abraham is relieved. However, despite God's promise, Lot's family is still living in Sodom when it is destroyed by fire and brimstone.\n\nThe story ends with a commentary on the nature of righteousness and the mercy of God.",
